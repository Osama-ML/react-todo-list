# Frontend - TODO List Test

This project was made to test my skills in Frontend

## First time cloning project

Run `npm i` for install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

## Development server

Run `nmp` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
